        <p class="fade-paragraph">Nanotechnology is the science of manipulating matter at the atomic and molecular scale, typically below 100 nanometers. 
        It involves designing, producing, and using structures, devices, and systems by controlling shape and size at the 
        nanometer scale. This groundbreaking technology is transforming various fields, from medicine and electronics to 
        materials science, by creating innovative solutions with enhanced properties and functionalities.</p>

                <h2 class="fade-paragraph">Introduction to Nanotechnology: Looking At Nanoparticles</h2>
                <p class="fade-paragraph">Scientists have been studying and working with nanoparticles for centuries, 
                but the effectiveness of their work has been hampered by their inability to see the structure of nanoparticles.
                In recent decades the development of microscopes capable of displaying particles as small as atoms has allowed 
                scientists to see what they are working with.The following illustration titled “The Scale of Things”, created 
                by the U. S. Department of Energy, provides a comparison of various objects to help you begin to envision 
                exactly how small a nanometer is. The chart starts with objects that can be seen by the unaided eye, such as an 
                ant, at the top of the chart, and progresses to objects about a nanometer or less in size, such as the ATP molecule 
                used in humans to store energy from food.</p>

                <p class="imageBelow">Now that you have an idea of how small a scale nanotechnologists work with, consider 
                the challenge they face. Think about how difficult it is for many of us to insert thread through the eye of 
                a needle. Such an image helps you imagine the problem scientists have working with nanoparticles that can be 
                as much as one millionth the size of the thread. Only through the use of powerful microscopes can they hope to 
                'see' and manipulate these nano-sized particles.</p>

                The ability to see nano-sized materials has opened up a world of possibilities in a variety of industries 
                and scientific endeavors. Because nanotechnology is essentially a set of techniques that allow manipulation

                <h2>Drug Delivery</h2>
                <p>Today, most harmful side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy are a result of drug 
                  delivery methods that don't pinpoint their intended target cells accurately. Researchers at Harvard and MIT have 
                  been able to attach special RNA strands, measuring about 10 nm in diameter, to nanoparticles and fill the 
                  nanoparticles with a chemotherapy drug. These RNA strands are attracted to cancer cells. When the nanoparticle 
                  encounters a cancer cell it adheres to it and releases the drug into the cancer cell. This directed method of 
                  drug delivery has great potential for treating cancer patients while producing less side harmful affects than those 
                  produced by conventional chemotherapy.This targeted drug delivery method has the potential to significantly reduce 
                  the harmful side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy while improving its efficacy.

                <h2>Fabrics</h2>
                <p>The properties of familiar materials are being changed by manufacturers 
                  who are adding Nano-sized components to conventional materials to improve performance. 
                  For example piezoelectric fibers are being developed that could allow clothing to generate electricity 
                  through normal motions.Manufacturers are revolutionizing the properties of familiar 
                  materials by integrating nano-sized components into traditional materials, aiming 
                  to enhance their performance. An illustrative example of this innovation is the 
                  development of piezoelectric fibers, which have the potential to enable clothing 
                  to harness electricity from everyday movements. This advancement not only promises 
                  to revolutionize the functionality of textiles but also underscores the transformative 
                  impact of nanotechnology across various industries.

                <h2>Reactivity of Materials</h2>
                <p>The properties of many conventional materials change when 
                  formed as Nano-sized particles (nanoparticles). This is generally because nanoparticles 
                  have a greater surface area per weight than larger particles; they are therefore more 
                  reactive to some other molecules. For example studies have show that nanoparticles of 
                  iron can be effective in the cleanup of chemicals in groundwater because they react 
                  more efficiently to those chemicals than larger iron particles. Nanoparticles exhibit 
                  increased reactivity due to their greater surface area per weight, making them efficient 
                  in various applications. For example, studies have shown that iron nanoparticles can 
                  effectively clean up chemicals in groundwater by reacting more efficiently than larger 
                  iron particles.This heightened reactivity at the nanoscale holds promise for addressing 
                  environmental challenges and improving the efficacy of remediation techniques.

                <h2>Strength of Materials</h2>
                <p>Nano-sized particles of carbon, (for example nanotubes and bucky balls) 
                  are extremely strong. Nanotubes and bucky balls are composed of only carbon and their strength 
                  comes from special characteristics of the bonds between carbon atoms. One proposed application 
                  that illustrates the strength of Nano sized particles of carbon is the manufacture of t-shirt 
                  weight bullet proof vests made out of carbon nanotubes. The exceptional strength of nano-sized 
                  carbon particles, such as nanotubes and buckyballs, arises from the unique characteristics of 
                  carbon atom bonds. This strength has spurred innovative applications, including the development 
                  of lightweight bulletproof vests made from carbon nanotubes, showcasing the potential for 
                  nanotechnology to revolutionize protective gear and enhance personal safety.

                <h2>Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems</h2>
                <p>The ability to create gears, mirrors, sensor elements, as well as electronic 
                  circuitry in silicon surfaces allows the manufacture of miniature sensors such as those used to activate 
                  the airbags in your car. This technique is called MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems). The MEMS 
                  technique results in close integration of the mechanical mechanism with the necessary electronic circuit 
                  on a single silicon chip, similar to the method used to produce computer chips. Using MEMS to produce a 
                  device reduces both the cost and size of the product, compared to similar devices made with conventional 
                  methods. MEMS is a stepping stone to NEMS or Nano-Electro Mechanical Systems. NEMS products are being made 
                  by a few companies, and will take over as the standard once manufacturers make the investment in the equipment 
                  needed to produce nano-sized features.

                <h2>Molecular Manufacturing</h2>
                <p>If you're a Star Trek fan, you remember the replicator, a device that could produce 
                  anything from a space age guitar to a cup of Earl Grey tea. Your favorite character just programmed the 
                  replicator, and whatever he or she wanted appeared. Researchers are working on developing a method called 
                  molecular manufacturing that may someday make the Star Trek replicator a reality. The gadget these folks 
                  envision is called a molecular fabricator; this device would use tiny manipulators to position atoms and 
                  molecules to build an object as complex as a desktop computer. Researchers believe that raw materials can 
                  be used to reproduce almost any inanimate object using this method.  represents a groundbreaking leap in 
                  manufacturing technology, holding the potential to revolutionize production processes and materialize objects 
                  with unprecedented precision and versatility.

                    <p>There are many different points of view about the nanotechnology. These differences 
                      start with the definition of nanotechnology. Some define it as any activity that involves 
                      manipulating materials between one nanometer and 100 nanometers. However the original 
                      definition of nanotechnology involved building machines at the molecular scale and involves 
                      the manipulation of materials on an atomic (about two-tenths of a nanometer) scale.

                  <p>Every iron atom has four unpaired electrons around each atom. When unpaired electrons 
                    align in a certain way, a magnetic field is formed.</p>
                  <p>
                    Iron nanoparticles retain the magnetic properties of iron and also have a larger surface area. 
                    Nanoparticles formed from iron can have several uses. For example, you can use iron nanoparticles 
                    in settings such as medical imaging and the clean up of groundwater.

                  <p>When iron rusts, it forms iron oxide (a combination of iron and oxygen), which has magnetic 
                    properties like iron but is less magnetic due to having only two unpaired electrons, a property 
                    known as paramagnetic. When iron oxide forms into nanoparticles, they retain their paramagnetic 
                    properties and can be used in settings where larger particles aren't. Magnetic resonance imaging 
                    (MRI) produces improved images using paramagnetic nanoparticles that attach to any object being 
                    imaged. Researchers have coated iron oxide nanoparticles with molecules that target objects such 
                    as cancer tumors. By making nanoparticles with a core of iron oxide nanocrystals surrounded by 
                    nanoporous silica, even better images of tumors can be obtained, and this method could also 
                    control the release of therapeutic drugs.

                  <h2 class="image-title">Gold Nanoparticles</h2>
                  <p>The world of medical treatments has looked to various materials throughout the decades 
                    to provide treatments, but some materials, such as platinum, can be toxic. Gold has proven 
                    useful in the past, and when researchers created gold nanoparticles, they discovered new 
                    capabilities. Molecules can attach to gold nanoparticles and target diseased parts of the body, 
                    including cancer tumors, enabling more targeted drug delivery. Gold nanoparticles with a diameter 
                    of 5 nm or less also offer new opportunities. Unlike bulk gold, which is inert and not useful for 
                    chemical reactions, these small particles can act as catalysts for reactions, such as converting 
                    air pollution into harmless molecules or oxidizing carbon monoxide.

                  <p>Platinum is a remarkably efficient catalyst, though costly. Catalytic converters in cars,
                    for example, use platinum as a catalyst that converts molecules in pollution to partially purify 
                    them.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Atoms in molecules can bond with platinum atoms. The resulting atoms can, in some cases, react with 
                    other molecules. When molecules break up into atoms, platinum can act as a catalyst for chemical 
                    reactions that happen at lower temperatures. Platinum nanoparticles can be used to increase surface 
                    area available for a reaction. This larger surface area ups the percentage of platinum atoms that are 
                    available to contact other molecules in the reaction. That means you can use a smaller amount of platinum 
                    to create a reaction that can break down pollutants, which is good news considering the material's cost!

                    silver offers good thermal and electrical conductivity. Silver nanoparticles, because

                    foods that have been previously stored in the containers, in getting rid of odors; this 
                    is possible because microorganisms in the form of microbes simply can't live near silver 
                    ions, and making low-cost filters. When created with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires,

                    Titanium dioxide also reflects colors in the visible light spectrum as white light. Why is this useful? 
                    This ability makes the material useful in providing a white pigment in paints. It's also what produces 
                    some white residue on your skin when you use sunscreen. Titanium dioxide is also used in creams and

                          electronic properties of 3D graphite. Then, in 1986, three chemists by the name of Boehm, 
                          Setton, and Stumpp found that, within bulk materials, lay single layers of graphite seen 
                          inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation. They coined the term graphene. Graphene is 
                          the term used for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Imagine a super fast charging battery 
                          for your phone, that's what graphene could be used for! This wonder material is being

                        Ekimov worked for the Vavilov State Optical Institute. By late 1982 Louis E. Brus, a chemist 
                        at Bell Laboratories, found quantum dots in colloidal solutions. Brus found that quantum dots 
                        emitted or absorbed a wavelength of light. This wavelength changed over time as the nanocrystal grew. 
                        Applications being developed for quantum dots include improvement of solar cells, medical imaging, 
                        miniature lasers and improved computer and TV displays. Quantum dots are nanoparticles that glow a

          </div>
          <div class="section-UniqueFeatures">
            <p>Nanotechnology involves operating at a very small dimension and it allows scientists 
              to make use of the exceptional optical, chemical, physical, mechanical, and biological 
              qualities of materials of that small scale. The following are the distinct features of 
              nanoscale (nano.gov 2021):

          </div>

              <div class="cardUnique">
                <div class="frontUnique">
                  <div class="frontTitle">Scale at which biology occurs</div>
                </div>
                <div class="backUnique">
                  <p>Various activities of the cells take place at the nanoscale. The deoxyribonucleic 
                    acid (DNA) serves as the genetic material of the cell and is only about 2 nanometers 
                    in diameter. Furthermore, the hemoglobin that transports oxygen to the tissues throughout 
                    the body is 5.5 nanometers in diameter.
                  </p>
                  <p>A good number of modern researches focus on advancing procedures, therapies, tools, 
                    and treatments that are more accurate and custom-made than traditional methods and 
                    cause no adverse effects on the body.
                  </p>
                  <p>An example of this is the bio-barcode assay, which is a fairly inexpensive 
                    approach for identification of specific disease markers in the blood despite 
                    their small number in a particular specimen.

                <div class="backUniqueTwo">
                  <p>At the nanoscale (1-100 nanometers), materials exhibit unique properties due to quantum effects. Their 
                    chemical reactivity, fluorescence, magnetism, melting point, and conductivity vary with size.
                  </p>
                  <p>A prime example of this phenomenon is nanoscale gold, which can appear red or purple instead of the typical 
                    yellow color we associate with bulk gold, owing to the restricted motion of electrons at the nanoscale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remarkably, these nanoscale gold particles can selectively accumulate in tumors, enabling precise imaging and 
                    targeted laser-based destruction of the cancerous cells while avoiding damage to healthy tissues, a capability 
                    that stems from the unique properties of materials at the nanoscale.

                  <p>As we increase the surface area per mass of a particular material, a greater amount of

            <p>Nanotechnology involves engineering of functional systems at the atomic or molecular level. 
              It can create many new materials and devices with wide-ranging applications such as in medicine, 
              energy, agriculture, food production, space science, and electronics among others (dost.gov.ph).
            </p>
            <p>  Through its attached agency the Philippine Council for Advance Science and Technology Research 
              and Development, the Department of Science and Technology developed a roadmap for the goals and 
              future of nanotechnology in the country. The roadmap shows a blueprint of focused research and 
              development in exploring and capitalizing on high impact and life-improving advantages of 
              nanotechnology (dost.gov.ph).
            </p>
            <p>In the country, there are currently few Filipino experts working on nanotechnology development 
              who have successfully integrated it in biotechnology and materials science. There is a need for 
              more expert and willing scientists who will contribute in the expansion of this emerging field of 
              science.
            </p>
            <p>Under the national nanotechnology roadmap, DOST whittled down its priority projects to ICT and 
              semiconductors, agriculture and food, energy, medicine, and environment due to the modest research 
              and development fund (dost.gov.ph).

                The Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD) in 
                collaboration with other institutions such as Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Philippine Genome Center, University of the Philippines, 
                and Ateneo de Manila University developed the biosensor kit called PhilGeneStrips for the detection of disease in shrimps (DOST 2015).
            </div>
            <div class="item ">
                PhilGeneStrips is cost-efficient, easy to use in the field, and has the ability to properly identify those with the disease as well as those without. 
                It can also detect White Spot Syndrome (WSS) virus. WSS is a viral infection which is contagious and can quickly lead to death. 
                This innovation is very helpful for elimination of diseases in shrimps that firstly benefits the farmers.
            </div>
            <div class="item ">
                Another innovation of nanotechnology in the country is the creation of water treatment system called the Portable Ceramic Water Filter (Pitcher Type). 
                Through the principle of gravity, the two-liter capacity water filter is able to sift tap or deep well water using red clay with nanotechnology silver 
                coating as the primary filtering agent (DOST 2015).
